## Currency Converter 
***
### Description 
A full-stack currency conversion application that allows users to convert between 
different currencies using real-time exchange rates. The project features a Java 
backend with Gradle and a TypeScript frontend, providing a seamless and efficient 
experience.

### 🚀 Features  
- 🔄 Convert between multiple currencies
- 🌎 Fetches real-time exchange rates from CurrencyAPI
- 🎨 User-friendly interface built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
- 🏗️ Backend powered by Java and Spring Boot
- ⚡ Uses Gradle for build automation

🌐 How It Works
- **Frontend Interaction:** The frontend collects user input (currencies and amounts) 
and sends it to the backend using an API request. 
- **Backend Processing:** The Java Spring backend processes the request, fetches the 
relevant exchange rate data from [CurrencyAPI](https://currencyapi.com/), and calculates the conversion.
- **Response to Frontend:** The backend sends the calculated result back to the frontend, 
which displays the conversion to the user.

This seamless communication between the frontend and backend ensures efficient and real-time currency conversion.
